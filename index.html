        <p>
            Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee OM KBE FRS FREng FRSA DFBCS (born 8 June 1955), also known as TimBL, is an
            English computer scientist best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web. He is a Professorial Fellow of
            Computer Science at the University of Oxford and a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
            (MIT). Berners-Lee proposed an information management system on 12 March 1989, then implemented
            the first successful communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the
            Internet in mid-November.
            <br><br>
            Berners-Lee is the director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which oversees the continued development
            of the Web. He co-founded (with his then wife-to-be Rosemary Leith) the World Wide Web Foundation. He is a
            senior researcher and holder of the 3Com founder's chair at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial
            Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL). He is a director of the Web Science Research Initiative (WSRI) and
            a member of the advisory board of the MIT Center for Collective Intelligence. In 2011, he was named
            as a member of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation. He is a founder and president of the Open
            Data Institute and is currently an advisor at social network MeWe.
            <br><br>
            He devised and implemented the first Web browser and Web server, and helped foster the Web's subsequent
            explosive development. He currently directs the W3 Consortium, developing tools and standards to further the
            Web's potential. In April 2009, he was elected as Foreign Associate of the National Academy of
            Sciences.
            <br><br>
            In 2004, Berners-Lee was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his pioneering work. He was named in
            Time magazine's list of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th century and has received a number of other
            accolades for his invention. He was honoured as the "Inventor of the World Wide Web" during the 2012
            Summer Olympics opening ceremony in which he appeared working with a vintage NeXT Computer. He tweeted
            "This is for everyone" which appeared in LED lights attached to the chairs of the audience. He
            received the 2016 Turing Award "for inventing the World Wide Web, the first web browser, and the fundamental
            protocols and algorithms allowing the Web to scale".
